The What Day is It website provides the user with a more covenient way to remain fit.  Our website will provide the user with a calendar which will allow the user to choose the day of the week and a random workout will be generated/shown based on different workout criteria (muscle group, type of workout, workout duration etc.)  Using two different server-side APIs the user can get a professional grade work out in the comfort of his or her own home or anywhere on the run for that matter.

## User story
